We present abmR, an R package for conducting continental-scale ABM simulations across animal taxa. The package features two movement functions, each of which relies on the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (OU) process. The theoretical background for abmR is discussed and the main functionalities are illustrated using example populations. Potential future additions to this open-source package may include the ability to specify multiple environmental variables or to model interactions between agents. Additionally, updates may offer opportunities for disease ecology and integration with other R movement modelling packages.},

abstract = {Reliable estimates of the distribution of species abundance are a key element in wildlife studies, but such information is usually difficult to obtain for large spatial or long temporal scales. Wildlife–vehicle collision (WVC) data is systematically registered in many countries and could be used as a proxy of population abundance if the number of WVC in each territory increase with the population abundance. However, factors such as road density or human population should be controlled to obtain accurate abundance estimations from WVC data. Here, we propose a hierarchical modeling approach using the Royle–Nichols model for detection–non-detection data to obtain population abundance indices from WVC. Relative abundance and individual detectability were modeled for two species, wild boar Sus scrofa and roe deer Capreolus capreolus at 10 × 10 km cells in mainland Spain from WVC data using environmental, anthropological and temporal covariates. For each cell, a detection was annotated if at least one WVC was recorded at each month (used as survey occasion). The predicted abundance indices were compared with raw hunting statistics at region level to assess the performance of the modeling approach. Site specific covariates such as road density or administrative region and the month of the year, affected individual detectability, with higher WVC probability between October and December for wild boar and between April and July for roe deer. Wild boar and roe deer abundance can be explained by both, bioclimatic and land cover covariates. Abundance indices obtained from WVC data were significantly positively correlated with regional raw hunting yields for both species. We presented empirical evidence supporting that accurate wildlife abundance indices at fine spatial resolution can be generated from WVC data when individual detectability is considered in the modeling process.},

abstract = {Abstract Species distribution models based on environmental predictors are useful to explain a species geographic range. For many groups of organisms, including fungi, the increase in occurrence data sets has generalized their use. However, fungal species are not always easy to distinguish, and taxonomy of many groups is not completely settled. This study explores the effect of taxonomic uncertainty in databases used for modeling fungal distributions. We analyze distribution models for three morphospecies from the corticioid genus Xylodon (Hymenochaetales, Basidiomycota), comparing models based on species names on vouchers specimens with models derived from species identified by DNA barcode. Differences in the contribution of predictors driving the distribution of each modeled taxon and the extent of their ranges were studied. Records under Xylodon paradoxus, X. flaviporus, and X. raduloides were obtained from fungarium collections and GenBank repository. Two grouping criteria were used: (a) specimens were grouped by their collection or sequence voucher names and (b) specimens were grouped following molecular identification using ITS sequences through barcoding gap species recognition (BGSR). Climatic, geographic, and biotic variables were used to predict the potential distribution of each taxon through MaxEnt algorithm. From the three morphospecies selected according to voucher names, up to 19 species candidates were detected using BGSR. Climatic variables were the most important predictors in distribution models made from names on voucher specimens, but their importance decreased when BGSR was applied. In general, the extent of species distributions was more restricted for taxa under BGSR. Our results show that taxonomic uncertainty has a strong effect in Xylodon species distribution models. Misleading results can be obtained when cryptic species or identification errors mask the actual diversity of the presence records. Preserved specimens in natural history collections offer the possibility to assess whether the species name on labels matches the current species recognition criteria.},

abstract = {Abstract Camera-trapping methods have been used to monitor movement and behavioural ecology parameters of wildlife. However, when considering movement behaviours to estimate DR is mandatory to include in the formulation the speed ratio, otherwise DR results will be biased. For instance, some wildlife populations present movement patterns characteristic of each behaviour (e.g. foraging or displacement between habitat patches), and further research is needed to integrate the behaviours in the estimation of movement parameters. In this respect, the day range (average daily distance travelled by an individual, DR) is a model parameter that relies on movement and behaviour. This study aims to provide a step forward concerning the use of camera-trapping in movement and behavioural ecology. We describe a machine learning procedure to differentiate movement behaviours from camera-trap data, and revisit the approach to consider different behaviours in the estimation of DR. Second, working within a simulated framework we tested the performance of three approaches to estimate DR: DROB (i.e. estimating DR without behavioural identification), DRTB (i.e. estimating DR by identifying behaviours manually and weighting each behaviour on the basis of the encounter rate obtained) and DRRB (i.e. estimating DR based on the classification of movement behaviours by a machine learning procedure and the ratio between speeds). Finally, we evaluated these approaches for 24 wild mammal species with different behavioural and ecological traits. The machine learning procedure to differentiate behaviours showed high accuracy (mean = 0.97). The DROB approach generated accurate results in scenarios with a speed-ratio (fast relative to slow behaviours) lower than 10, and for scenarios in which the animals spend most of the activity period on the slow behaviour. However, when considering movement behaviours to estimate DR is mandatory to include in the formulation the speed ratio, otherwise the DR results will be biased. The new approach, DRRB, generated accurate results in all the scenarios. The results obtained from real populations were consistent with the simulations. In conclusion, the integration of behaviours and speed-ratio in camera-trap studies makes it possible to obtain unbiased DR. Speed-ratio should be considered so that fast behaviour is not overrepresented. The procedures described in this work extend the applicability of camera-trap-based approaches in both movement and behavioural ecology.},

In this region, precipitation and temperature can affect the distribution of these birds through direct (thermoregulation costs) or indirect effects (primary productivity). Thus, it can be postulated that projected climate changes in the region will affect the extent and suitability of their wintering grounds. We studied pipit and chiffchaff abundance in several hundred localities along a belt crossing Spain and Morocco and assessed the effects of climate and other geographical and habitat predictors on bird distribution. Multivariate analyses reported a positive effect of temperature on the present distribution of the two species, with an additional effect of precipitation on the meadow pipit. These climate variables were used with Maxent to model the occurrence probabilities of species using ring recoveries as presence data. Abundance and occupancy of the two species in the study localities adjusted to the distribution models, with more birds in sectors of high climate suitability. After validation, these models were used to forecast the distribution of climate suitability according to climate projections for 2050–2070 (temperature increase and precipitation reduction). Results show an expansion of climatically suitable sectors into the highlands by the effect of warming on the two species, and a retreat of the meadow pipit from southern sectors related to rain reduction. The predicted patterns show a mean increase in climate suitability for the two species due to the warming of the large highland expanses typical of the western Mediterranean.},

abstract = {Abstract Harvest data have the potential to be used as an abundance index due to its widespread availability and long-term collection across large geographical areas. However, challenges such as the lack of hunting effort information, varying data resolutions and reporting biases hinder its direct use as an abundance proxy. Here, we present the game target-group, a statistical approach based on a thinned inhomogeneous Poisson point process, to estimate animal abundance at fine-scale resolution from hunting data. We employ a Bayesian hierarchical framework to borrow information from harvest data on related species to overcome issues due to the lack of hunting management information. We conducted a simulation study to explore model performance and parameter identifiability under different scenarios (sample size, species catchability/abundance and unmodelled heterogeneity) and assessed the method on a real case study with four species in central Spain. The simulation study confirmed that with a large enough sample size (n > 5000), high catchability and lack of unmodelled heterogeneity in the abundance process, the model was able to obtain unbiased estimations for total abundance parameters. In the case study, our model successfully captured species-habitat relationships and produced reliable estimates of total abundance at regional scale. Internal validation with independent test data and external validation with fieldwork data confirmed the model's ability to predict hunting yields and estimate species total abundance accurately. Our approach provides a flexible and valuable tool for large-scale monitoring programs relying on harvest data with potential applications in wildlife management and conservation. However, the method should be applied with caution when there is unmodelled heterogeneity, low catchability or the sample size is small (<5000).},
